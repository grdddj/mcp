# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python CLI tool for interacting with OpenAI's ChatGPT API, built using `uv` for package management. The tool supports both one-shot queries and interactive conversations with context memory, token usage tracking, and cost estimation.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies and setup
uv sync

# Run the CLI tool directly
uv run openai_cli.py "Your prompt here"

# Install as uv tool for system-wide use
uv tool install .

# Run installed tool
openai-cli "Your prompt here"

# Development with specific Python file
uv run python openai_cli.py -i --stats

# Code quality and formatting (run after each change)
ruff check --fix
ruff format
```

## Architecture

The codebase follows a clean separation of concerns:

**Core Components:**
- `openai_client.py`: Reusable API client with token tracking
- `openai_cli.py`: CLI interface with interactive and single-shot modes
- `example_usage.py`: Demonstrates programmatic usage

**Key Design Patterns:**

1. **Reusable Client Function**: `get_openai_response()` in `openai_client.py` is the core function that can be imported by other Python files. It returns an `OpenAIResponse` NamedTuple containing both content and usage statistics.

2. **Environment Configuration**: Uses `.env` file for API keys and default model selection. Priority: CLI flags > .env variables > hardcoded defaults.

3. **Conversation Context**: Interactive mode maintains conversation history as a list of message dictionaries, passed to each API call to preserve context.

4. **Token Usage Architecture**: 
   - Non-streaming responses include full `TokenUsage` information with cost estimation
   - Streaming responses return `usage=None` and show a warning when stats are requested
   - Cost estimation uses hardcoded pricing table in `estimate_cost()` function

## Configuration

The tool expects these environment variables in `.env`:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Required for API access
- `OPENAI_MODEL`: Optional default model (can be overridden with `-m` flag)

## CLI Interface Design

The CLI supports multiple modes through flag combinations:
- Single-shot: `openai-cli "prompt"`
- Interactive: `openai-cli -i` (maintains conversation context)
- Streaming: `openai-cli -s` (real-time response, no token stats)
- Statistics: `openai-cli --stats` (shows token usage and cost, non-streaming only)

Interactive mode uses `conversation_history` list to maintain context across turns, allowing for follow-up questions that reference previous conversation.

## Code Quality Guidelines

**Always run after each change:**
```bash
ruff check --fix  # Fix linting issues automatically
ruff format       # Format code consistently
```

**Type Hints (Python 3.11+ style):**
- Use lowercase built-in type hints: `list[str]`, `dict[str, str]`, `tuple[int, str]`
- Avoid importing from `typing` for basic types (List, Dict, Tuple)
- Still use `typing` for complex types: `Iterator`, `NamedTuple`, `Optional`
- All functions must have complete type annotations for parameters and return values

Examples:
```python
# Good - Python 3.11+ style
def process_messages(messages: list[dict[str, str]]) -> str:
    ...

def get_config() -> dict[str, str | int]:
    ...

# Still import from typing for these
from typing import Iterator, Optional, NamedTuple

def stream_data() -> Iterator[str]:
    ...
```

## Important Implementation Details

- The `get_openai_response()` function in `openai_client.py` is designed to be imported and used by other Python files
- Token usage statistics are only available in non-streaming mode due to OpenAI API limitations
- Price estimation is based on hardcoded rates in `estimate_cost()` function - update when OpenAI pricing changes
- Interactive mode handles graceful exits (EOF, KeyboardInterrupt, 'exit'/'quit' commands)
- The CLI uses `argparse` with `nargs='?'` for optional prompt in interactive mode
